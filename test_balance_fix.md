# Test Balance Fix

## Bug Report
**Issue**: Balance calculation was incorrect
- Pending transactions were counted as confirmed
- After logout/login, balance changed unexpectedly
- Example: C→A transfer of 50 coins showed A=50 immediately (before mining)

## Root Cause
1. `get_balance()` counted **pending transactions** (not yet confirmed)
2. No validation before creating transactions
3. After logout, pending tx were lost → balance mismatch

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Balance Calculation Fix
**File**: `core/blockchain.py`

**Before**:
```python
def get_balance(self, address):
    balance = 0
    # ... count from chain ...
    # WRONG: Count pending transactions
    for tx in self.pending_transactions:
        if tx.sender == address:
            balance -= tx.amount
        if tx.receiver == address:
            balance += tx.amount
    return balance
```

**After**:
```python
def get_balance(self, address):
    """Only count CONFIRMED transactions from chain"""
    balance = 0
    for block in self.chain:
        if block.transaction:
            if block.transaction.sender == address:
                balance -= block.transaction.amount
            if block.transaction.receiver == address:
                balance += block.transaction.amount
    # DO NOT count pending (unconfirmed) transactions
    return balance
```

### 2. Added Helper Methods
```python
def get_pending_balance(self, address):
    """Get pending (unconfirmed) balance"""
    
def get_total_balance(self, address):
    """Get (confirmed, pending, total) tuple"""
```

### 3. Transaction Validation
**File**: `core/blockchain.py` - `add_transaction()`

Added validation:
```python
# Validate sender balance before adding to pool
sender_balance = self.get_balance(transaction.sender)
if sender_balance < transaction.amount:
    raise ValueError("Insufficient balance!")
```

**File**: `network/node.py` - `create_transaction()`

Added validation:
```python
current_balance = self.blockchain.get_balance(self.username)
if current_balance < amount:
    raise ValueError(f"Insufficient balance! Current: {current_balance}")
```

### 4. UI Improvements
**File**: `main.py`

**Balance display** now shows:
```
💰 BALANCE INFORMATION
✅ Confirmed Balance: 100 coins
⏳ Pending Balance:   -50 coins
📊 Total Balance:     50 coins
```

**Transaction creation** shows warning:
```
💡 Transaction is pending. Mine a block to confirm it!
```

## Expected Behavior (After Fix)

### Scenario 1: C transfers 50 to A

**Initial State:**
- C: 100 coins (confirmed)
- A: 0 coins (confirmed)

**Step 1: C creates transaction (C→A: 50)**
```
C check balance:
  ✅ Confirmed: 100 coins
  ⏳ Pending: -50 coins
  📊 Total: 50 coins

A check balance:
  ✅ Confirmed: 0 coins
  ⏳ Pending: +50 coins
  📊 Total: 50 coins
```
⚠️ **Note**: Pending is shown but NOT counted as spendable!

**Step 2: A mines the block**
```
A check balance:
  ✅ Confirmed: 50 coins  (transaction confirmed)
  ⏳ Pending: +10 coins  (mining reward pending)
  📊 Total: 60 coins

C check balance:
  ✅ Confirmed: 50 coins
  ⏳ Pending: 0 coins
  📊 Total: 50 coins
```

**Step 3: Someone mines reward block**
```
A check balance:
  ✅ Confirmed: 60 coins  (reward confirmed)
  ⏳ Pending: 0 coins
  📊 Total: 60 coins
```

**Step 4: Logout → Login**
```
A login:
  💰 Confirmed balance: 60 coins  ✅ CORRECT!

C login:
  💰 Confirmed balance: 50 coins  ✅ CORRECT!
```

### Scenario 2: Try to double-spend

**Initial**: A has 60 coins confirmed

**Step 1**: A creates tx (A→B: 50)
```
✅ Success
A balance: Confirmed=60, Pending=-50, Total=10
```

**Step 2**: A tries to create tx (A→C: 50)
```
❌ Transaction failed: Insufficient balance! Current: 60, Required: 50
```
Why? Because A only has 60 confirmed, but already spent 50 in pending!

Wait... this is WRONG! The validation only checks confirmed balance (60), not accounting for pending (-50).

Need to fix this!

## Additional Fix Needed: Prevent Double-Spending

Current validation:
```python
current_balance = self.get_balance(self.username)  # Only confirmed
if current_balance < amount:
    raise ValueError(...)
```

Should be:
```python
confirmed, pending, total = self.get_total_balance(self.username)
available = confirmed + pending  # Account for pending expenses
if available < amount:
    raise ValueError(...)
```

**OR** simpler approach:
```python
# Calculate available balance (confirmed + pending)
confirmed = self.get_balance(self.username)
pending = self.get_pending_balance(self.username)
available = confirmed + pending

if available < amount:
    raise ValueError(f"Insufficient balance! Available: {available}")
```

This prevents double-spending by considering pending transactions!
