# Transaction Sync & Mining Loop Fix

## üêõ Bug Report

User "ngoc" reported 3 critical issues:

### Issue 1: Money Transfer Not Working
**Problem**: 
- A transfers money to B
- Money deducted from A (moves to pending)
- C mines successfully
- ‚ùå B does NOT receive the money

### Issue 2: Infinite Mining Loop
**Problem**:
- After first mine, can mine continuously
- Even when no pending transactions exist
- Pool never empties

### Issue 3: Balance Deduction But No Confirmation
**Problem**:
- A's balance shows pending deduction
- But transaction never gets confirmed on blockchain
- B never receives funds

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### Bug #1: Block Not Synced to Peers
**File**: `network/node.py` - `/block/new` route

**Problem**:
```python
@self.app.route('/block/new', methods=['POST'])
def new_block():
    # TODO: Validate v√† th√™m block v√†o chain  ‚Üê NEVER IMPLEMENTED!
    return jsonify({'message': 'Block received'})
```

**Impact**:
- When node C mines a block, it broadcasts to peers
- But peers just return 'Block received' and DO NOTHING
- Peers' blockchains are NEVER updated
- B never sees the transaction confirmed

### Bug #2: Mining Reward Creates Infinite Loop
**File**: `core/blockchain.py` - `mine_pending_transactions()`

**Problem**:
```python
def mine_pending_transactions(self, miner_address):
    # Mine transaction
    transaction = self.pending_transactions.pop(0)
    # ... create and mine block ...
    
    # ‚ùå BUG: Always add reward to pending
    reward_transaction = Transaction(
        sender="System",
        receiver=miner_address,
        amount=self.mining_reward
    )
    self.pending_transactions.append(reward_transaction)  # ‚Üê ALWAYS!
```

**Impact**:
1. Mine tx1 (A‚ÜíB) ‚Üí add reward to pending
2. Mine reward ‚Üí add another reward to pending
3. Mine reward ‚Üí add another reward to pending
4. **INFINITE LOOP!**

### Bug #3: Transaction Validation on Receiver Side
**Problem**:
- A creates transaction with available=100
- Broadcasts to B
- B's node tries to validate: "Does A have 100 coins?"
- But B's blockchain might not have A's history yet
- Validation fails with "Insufficient balance"

## ‚úÖ Solutions Implemented

### Fix #1: Implement Block Sync
**File**: `network/node.py` - `/block/new` route

```python
@self.app.route('/block/new', methods=['POST'])
def new_block():
    """Nh·∫≠n block m·ªõi t·ª´ peer"""
    data = request.get_json()
    
    try:
        # ‚úÖ FIX: Recreate block from dict
        block = Block.from_dict(data)
        
        # Validate block
        if block.previous_hash != self.blockchain.get_latest_block().hash:
            return jsonify({'error': 'Invalid previous_hash'}), 400
        
        if not block.hash.startswith('0' * self.blockchain.difficulty):
            return jsonify({'error': 'Invalid proof of work'}), 400
        
        # ‚úÖ FIX: Add block to chain
        self.blockchain.chain.append(block)
        
        # ‚úÖ FIX: Remove transaction t·ª´ pending n·∫øu c√≥
        if block.transaction:
            self.blockchain.pending_transactions = [
                tx for tx in self.blockchain.pending_transactions
                if not (tx.sender == block.transaction.sender and
                        tx.receiver == block.transaction.receiver and
                        tx.amount == block.transaction.amount and
                        abs(tx.timestamp - block.transaction.timestamp) < 1)
            ]
        
        print(f"‚úÖ Received and added block #{block.index} from peer")
        return jsonify({'message': 'Block added successfully'})
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"‚ùå Error processing block: {str(e)}")
        return jsonify({'error': str(e)}), 400
```

**Added import**:
```python
from core.block import Block
```

**Result**: Peers now properly sync blocks and update their chains

### Fix #2: Prevent Mining Reward Infinite Loop
**File**: `core/blockchain.py` - `mine_pending_transactions()`

```python
def mine_pending_transactions(self, miner_address):
    if not self.pending_transactions:
        print("No transactions to mine!")
        return None
    
    transaction = self.pending_transactions.pop(0)
    
    # ... create and mine block ...
    
    self.chain.append(new_block)
    
    # ‚úÖ FIX: Only add reward for USER transactions, not System transactions
    if transaction.sender != "System" and transaction.sender != "Genesis":
        reward_transaction = Transaction(
            sender="System",
            receiver=miner_address,
            amount=self.mining_reward
        )
        self.pending_transactions.append(reward_transaction)
        print(f"üí∞ Mining reward of {self.mining_reward} coins added to pending pool")
    
    return new_block
```

**Result**: 
- Mining reward only added for real user transactions
- No reward for mining reward blocks ‚Üí no infinite loop
- Miner must wait for real transactions to get rewards

### Fix #3: Better Transaction Validation Logging
**File**: `network/node.py` - `/transaction/new` route

```python
@self.app.route('/transaction/new', methods=['POST'])
def new_transaction():
    """Nh·∫≠n transaction m·ªõi t·ª´ peer"""
    data = request.get_json()
    
    try:
        transaction = Transaction.from_dict(data)
        
        # ‚úÖ FIX: Check if transaction already exists (prevent duplicates)
        already_exists = any(
            tx.sender == transaction.sender and
            tx.receiver == transaction.receiver and
            tx.amount == transaction.amount and
            abs(tx.timestamp - transaction.timestamp) < 1
            for tx in self.blockchain.pending_transactions
        )
        
        if already_exists:
            print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è Transaction already in pending pool, skipping")
            return jsonify({'message': 'Transaction already exists'})
        
        self.blockchain.add_transaction(transaction)
        print(f"‚úÖ Received transaction from peer: {transaction}")
        return jsonify({'message': 'Transaction added successfully'})
    except ValueError as e:
        # ‚úÖ FIX: Better error handling
        print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è Transaction validation failed: {str(e)}")
        return jsonify({'error': str(e)}), 400
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"‚ùå Error processing transaction: {str(e)}")
        return jsonify({'error': str(e)}), 400
```

**Result**: 
- Prevents duplicate transactions in pending pool
- Better logging for debugging
- Distinguishes validation errors from other errors

## üß™ Expected Behavior After Fix

### Scenario: A sends 50 coins to B, C mines

**Step 1: A creates transaction**
```
A's node:
  - Creates transaction A‚ÜíB: 50
  - Adds to own pending pool
  - Broadcasts to peers (B, C)
  
B's node:
  - Receives transaction
  - Validates (may fail if doesn't have A's history)
  - If valid, adds to pending pool
  
C's node:
  - Receives transaction
  - Validates
  - Adds to pending pool

A checks balance:
  ‚úÖ Confirmed: 100 coins
  ‚è≥ Pending: -50 coins
  üìä Total: 50 coins
```

**Step 2: C mines the block**
```
C's node:
  - Pops A‚ÜíB transaction from pending
  - Mines block (POW)
  - Adds block to chain
  - Adds mining reward to pending
  - Broadcasts block to peers (A, B)

A's node:
  - Receives block
  - Validates and adds to chain
  - Removes A‚ÜíB from pending pool

B's node:
  - Receives block
  - Validates and adds to chain
  - Removes A‚ÜíB from pending pool

A checks balance:
  ‚úÖ Confirmed: 50 coins  ‚Üê Updated!
  ‚è≥ Pending: 0 coins
  üìä Total: 50 coins

B checks balance:
  ‚úÖ Confirmed: 50 coins  ‚Üê Received!
  ‚è≥ Pending: 0 coins
  üìä Total: 50 coins

C checks balance:
  ‚úÖ Confirmed: 100 coins (from genesis)
  ‚è≥ Pending: +10 coins (mining reward)
  üìä Total: 110 coins
```

**Step 3: Someone mines the reward**
```
Any node mines:
  - Pops C's reward from pending
  - Mines block
  - Adds block to chain
  - NO NEW REWARD (sender is System)
  - Broadcasts to peers

C checks balance:
  ‚úÖ Confirmed: 110 coins  ‚Üê Reward confirmed!
  ‚è≥ Pending: 0 coins
  üìä Total: 110 coins
```

**Step 4: Try to mine again**
```
Any node tries to mine:
  ‚ùå "No transactions to mine!"
  
‚úÖ CORRECT: No infinite loop!
```

## üìä Comparison: Before vs After

| Issue | Before Fix | After Fix |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| **Transaction Sync** | ‚ùå Peers don't update chain | ‚úÖ Peers sync blocks |
| **Money Transfer** | ‚ùå B never receives | ‚úÖ B receives after mine |
| **Mining Loop** | ‚ùå Infinite mining | ‚úÖ Only mines real tx |
| **Pending Pool** | ‚ùå Never empties | ‚úÖ Empties after mine |
| **Balance Consistency** | ‚ùå Inconsistent across nodes | ‚úÖ Consistent after sync |
| **Reward System** | ‚ùå Reward for reward | ‚úÖ Reward only for user tx |
